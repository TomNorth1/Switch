## A first person platformer game created for a game jam with the theme "Parallel"

This project was created for a game jam in Unreal Engine 4.26. The game is a first person platformer with a PSX aesthetic with mechanics inspired by the time gauntlet from Titanfall 2. I used a combination of Unreal Engine's Blueprint system and C++ programming to create the logic for the game, aswell as using the post-processing features alongside editing engine settings to create a lo-fi retro look akin to the aesthetics you would find PS1 era games.

In the game the player must switch between two parallel realities using a device on the characters wrist to solve puzzles, jump from platform to platform and avoid projectiles. The player must use their problem solving skills and quick reactions to switch between realities whilst jumping to stay alive and complete the course in the quickest time possible.

The game features:
* Checkpoint and respawning system
* Speedrun clock and stat monitoring to tell you how well you did once game is complete.
* Collapsing platforms
* Physics objects used to solve puzzles
* Enemy turrets that shoot projectiles at the player which can be disabled by removing batteries
